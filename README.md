# SoundProject

## Project Concept
We tried to find a balance between sound, visuals and interactivity, but it was difficult to pinpoint a specific idea since visuals and interactivity played a more potent role, and sound a subordinate role in the suggestions we brainstormed. We first clarified a specific genre: horror, since such a genre enables a prominent focus on sound. We decided our experience would take place in a haunted house and thus settled on a horror escape room concept. Through interacting with select objects, the main characters would be able to navigate through the setting to find necessary clues to escape. To resolve the aforementioned concern of sound playing a subordinate role, we decided to limit the visuals as much as possible by eliminating light. Therefore the user would be forced to hyperfocus on sound and subsequently use it to navigate through the house in search of clues. We added dialogues and necessary narrations to further aid users in their experience as well as to unfold a narrative. We deliberately placed clues so that it requires the user to explore every single room of the house. Without having explored the house and attempting to leave, it would unlock a special dialogue that would urge users to continue further their search for clues as a means to solve a riddle.

# Process
## Drawing 
Firstly visuals had to align with sounds, so we began to list important sounds relating to the furniture e.g., grandfather clock, mirror, telephone ringing, tv static etc. We didn't want to rely too much on visuals and thus kept the furniture count to a minimum. The drawing wasn't too much of an arduous process. The only thing that was challenging was drawing according to an established perspective. I used reference images from the videogame: "undertale" to aid this process. With regards to creating a horror ambience, we decided to exclude windows to further perpetuate claustrophobia and the notion that there is no escape. I used 3 key colours: red, black and white; black to embody absolute darkness, white for outlines of furniture and red for key furnitures. For example, the ripped portrait in the lobby, the telephone in the bedroom, the mirror in the bathroom and the exit door in the corridor are further spotlighted for emphasis using red. I saved each individual furniture as a separate png file and included images as reference for the positioning of these furnitures using code. With regards to character drawing, there was a strong preference for using silhouettes within the group. As such we decided to model our own characters using inspirations from the videogame: "limbo". I had to choose character colours that didn't collide with the background colours to ensure clarity and so decided to fill them with varying shades of grey. I saved these as one png file and reflected it to create another png file (characters facing left and right).

Thankfully, I had a background in sound design as a result of my music major and so was able to implement my knowledge on sound production for film from my previous classes. Thus, there weren't many difficulties when sound editing. The main softwares I used were PRO TOOLS, LOGIC and SOUNDLY. The first 2 were wonderful platforms for editing audio clips derived directly from Soundly, which is a software for film containing thousands of different sound samples e.g., footsteps, wind, white noise, door slamming etc. I was able to explore through various sounds within the Soundly sound library and import them into our project in Logic and Pro Tools. 
With regards to our choices of sound clips, and as previously mentioned, our group based our concept around horror and so naturally our focus was centered around eerie, unsettling noises to cause the users to feel uneasy. Hence, I used various sound clips: creaky doors, water running, wind, low droning noises, in addition to the dialogue that was pre-recorded by our group. 

### Creating the Script & Recording
We first generated a script that included various responses to specific events that occur within our sound experience. However, we found that our initial script was too long (nearly 4-5pgs) and so we really cut down on unecessary dialogue so that the script was mere 2 pages. We made sure not to exclude too much narration since again, the experience is centered around sound. We included dialogue for specific instances. For example, if the user had not explored all rooms in the house before attempting to leave, a specific dialogue would be triggered. If the user had explored thoroughly and so was able to find out the answer to the riddle, a special ending dialogue would be triggered. Once we had finalized the script, we began recording on Thursday. We had our trial script run recorded as a potential backup and then recorded our actual dialogue.
